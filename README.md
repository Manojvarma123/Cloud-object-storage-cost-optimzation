# Cloud-object-storage-cost-optimzation
Abstract 
The multi-tiered cloud storage services offer various tiers, such as          hot(optimized for data that's accessed frequently) and cool        tiers(infrequently used data), which are characterized by differentiated        attributes like access latency, access costs and throughput and the          corresponding storage costs. However, selecting among these storage tiers         to efficiently manage data and improve performance at a reduced cost is            still a major problem. In this paper, we answer this problem by developing             an optimized algorithm for automated data placement and movement         among both hot and cold storage tiers. â€‹ The algorithm uses no replication of             data and initially places the object in the hot tier. Then, based on the              read/write requests and access patterns, it may decide to move the object            to the cool tier to optimize the storage service cost. Additionally, we            demonstrate that our algorithm makes your storage costs reduce         considerably. Introduction
